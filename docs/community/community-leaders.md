# Community Leaders

Over 500 people and companies signed up to be notified about the opening of the Baseline Protocol Github repository between March 4th and 19th, 2020. Over 300 of them also signed in as group members. The [members](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/directory) represent many of the largest companies in the world, spanning several sectors. They also represent startups, students and talented individuals.

#### People listed here or appearing on community videos or in the github repos should be assumed to be representing themselves, and not necessarily the companies they work for.\*

> \*\(In the mid-1990s, the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) community amassed thousands of developers from many companies before any of those companies officially sanctioned their involvement.  Many of the companies participating in the Baseline Protocol initiative embrace the work, some already adding baselining to their strategic plans. But anyone observing someone's participation in the baseline community should assume that they do so as individuals. Please refrain from making assertions about the intentions of their employers.\)

### Bootstrapping Phase and Ongoing Phase

The technical steering committee and the chair listed below will be seated provisionally for six months, from From March 19, 2020 to September 31, 2020.

### Your Specifications Steering Committee

The specifications committee \(SSC\) is responsible for organizing the community and helping set functional and non-functional requirements as well as targeting use cases, industry verticals, and horizontal platforms & products. These are senior industry executives and influencers who can rally support for the work and help find ways to structure incentives for people to focus on key Epics and Stories in the [repo](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline). \(Note, epics and stories maintained in [Zenhub](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline#workspaces/baseline-5e713dc4f555144d9d6d17f6/board?repos=239590893).

SSC members are seated by consensus of the sitting members. There is no specific maximum number of seats, and it is expected that the members will form sub-committees for topics like industry verticals.
