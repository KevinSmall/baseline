# Technical Steering Committee

The core of the day-to-day work of the Baseline Protocol community is managed by [members](members.md) and [maintainers](maintainers.md). The Technical Steering Committee \(TSC\) is here mainly to ensure the smooth running of the maintainer team and to be accountable to the Ethereum-Oasis Project [Governance Board](community-leaders.md#your-project-governance-board) \(and to the community at large\).

While it is up to any contributor what one works on, the TSC helps maintainers and members by organizing planning and review sessions, roadmapping, and highlighting engineering tasks as high-priority for any given period.

For more on the TSC, see the [Governance section](governance.md).

## How to Join the TSC

The TSC's members are elected annually. The next election period is September 2020. The period for nominations will be announced no less than 30 days prior to elections. The method and management of the nominating process and the elections will be communicated to the community by the various [channels](community.md#communications-connecting-with-each-other-directly) in that timeframe.
